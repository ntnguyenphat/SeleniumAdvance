**INTRODUCTION**

Selenium Web Driver is a tool for writing automated tests of websites. It aims to mimic the behavior of a real user, and as such interacts with the HTML of the application.

Selenium Web Driver is also a web automation framework that allows you to execute your tests against different browsers.
